## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
   - Use a browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to view the application.

3. Ensure the following files are in the directory:
   ```plaintext
   frontend/
   |-- index.html
   |-- style.css
   |-- script.js
   ```

4. Edit or update the files as needed:
   - `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the project.
   - `style.css`: Styles the interface.
   - `script.js`: Includes the logic for dynamic functionality.

5. Refresh the browser to view any changes made to the files.
